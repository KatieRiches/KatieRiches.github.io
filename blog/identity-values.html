      <label for="ac-1" class="top">Ethical Choices</label>
      <article class="ac-small">
        <p>
          A few years ago, I was working for a small company, and we were in a
          highly competitive industry. One day, I overheard a conversation among
          some colleagues about a plan to gather information about a
          competitor's upcoming product launch. This information was not
          publicly available, and the plan involved contacting a former employee
          of the competitor who might have insider knowledge. The discussion was
          framed as a way to gain a competitive advantage. In this situation, I
          had to weigh several values and factors. On one hand, there was the
          pressure to succeed in a cutthroat industry, which could have
          justified taking this unethical shortcut. On the other hand, there
          were values like integrity, honesty, and respect for fair competition
          that I strongly believed in. I also considered the potential legal and
          reputational risks for both myself and the company. Ultimately, I
          decided to speak up against the plan and express my concerns to my
          colleagues and superiors. I emphasized the importance of competing
          fairly and ethically, even if it meant a tougher path to success. The
          decision was not easy, as it could have strained relationships and
          even jeopardized my job. However, it aligned with my core values and
          principles. Looking back on that decision, I feel proud of having
          upheld my ethical values. The situation served as a reminder that
          ethical conduct isn't always the easiest or most convenient path, but
          it's the one that maintains integrity and builds trust. I believe that
          making the right ethical choices, even in challenging circumstances,
          ultimately contributes to personal growth and the long-term success
          and reputation of individuals and organisations.

        <p>
          I come from a family of farmers in the south. During my childhood
          conditions were challenging. We lived on a very isolated property, we
          would often lose road access during winter and it would just be my
          family and I at home. However on the farm there were always animals
          needs that came before your own. They needed to be cared for, fed and
          watered before you could be. I think you can see this reflected in my
          work ethic. I am a task orientated person. I wanted to get work
          completed so I can move on to the next problem or relax.

        <p>
          I am task orientated, this is valuable as I can often ensure we stay
          on track and get the job completed. I am organised and often am the
          one aware of the details that need to be completed to finish a job. I
          value fairness and like to ensure everyone is given the opportunity to
          contribute. I like to see a team working to its strengths and this may
          include someone with a particular skillset directing others in a role.

          I have less of a people focus. This is a limitation I have been trying
          to improve over my career. I aim to improve this so that my task
          orientation can broaden to include how people are managing their load,
          needing help or just need a break.

          As the content so far is pre recorded, my main expectation is for
          pretty quick student support. As the course develops I expect this
          role will develop more into a course delivery role and facilitators
          will be there on the edge to answer student queries.

        <p>
          I have worked in teams when there have been team players who have not
          been contributing. To address this, I encouraged open communication
          and defined clear roles. Although these strategies had some positive
          impact, the resistance and tension persisted. Reflecting on the
          experience, I now realize the importance of active listening and
          empathy. In the future, I would prioritize creating a safe space for
          team members to express their concerns and opinions openly.
          Additionally, I would implement conflict resolution techniques, such
          as mediation or facilitated discussions, to address underlying issues
          directly. By fostering open dialogue and empathetic understanding, my
          goal is to promote a more collaborative and productive team
          environment.
