      <h2>
        An ethical obstacle
      </h2>
      <p>
        A few years ago, I was working for a small company, and we were in a
        highly competitive industry. One day, I overheard a conversation among
        some colleagues about a plan to gather information about a competitor's
        upcoming product launch. This information was not publicly available,
        and the plan involved contacting a former employee of the competitor who
        might have insider knowledge. The discussion was framed as a way to gain
        a competitive advantage.</p>
        
        <p>In this situation, I had to weigh several
        values and factors. On one hand, there was the pressure to succeed in a
        cutthroat industry, which could have justified taking this unethical
        shortcut. On the other hand, there were values like integrity, honesty,
        and respect for fair competition that I strongly believed in. I also
        considered the potential legal and reputational risks for both myself
        and the company. Ultimately, I decided to speak up against the plan and
        express my concerns to my colleagues and superiors. I emphasized the
        importance of competing fairly and ethically, even if it meant a tougher
        path to success. </p>
        
        <p>The decision was not easy, as it could have strained
        relationships and even jeopardized my job. However, it aligned with my
        core values and principles. Looking back on that decision, I feel proud
        of having upheld my ethical values. The situation served as a reminder
        that ethical conduct isn't always the easiest or most convenient path,
        but it's the one that maintains integrity and builds trust. I believe
        that making the right ethical choices, even in challenging
        circumstances, ultimately contributes to personal growth and the
        long-term success and reputation of individuals and organizations.</p>

       Culture and identity
      </h2>
      <p>I come from a family of farmers in the south. During my childhood conditions were challenging. We lived on a very isolated property, we would often lose road access during winter and it would just be my family and I at home. However on the farm there were always animals needs that came before your own. They needed to be cared for, fed and watered before you could be. I think you can see this reflected in my work ethic. I am a task orientated person. I wanted to get work completed so I can move on to the next problem or relax. </p>
      </div>


      <div class="paragraph">
        <h2>
My learning strengths        </h2>
        <p>I am task orientated, this is valuable as I can often ensure we stay on track and get the job completed. I am organised and often am the one aware of the details that need to be completed to finish a job. 
        </p><p>

          I value fairness and like to ensure everyone is given the opportunity to contribute. I like to see a team working to it’s strengths and this may include someone with a particular skillset directing others in a role. 
          </p>

          <h2>
            My learning limitations
          </h2>
          <p> 
            I have less of a people focus. This is a limitation I have been trying to improve over my career. I aim to improve this so that my task orientation can broaden to include how people are managing their load, needing help or just need a break.

            Working through productivity resistance and tension.
          </h2>
          <p> 
            I have worked in teams when there have been team players who have not been contributing. To address this, I encouraged open communication and defined clear roles. Although these strategies had some positive impact, the resistance and tension persisted. Reflecting on the experience, I now realize the importance of active listening and empathy. In the future, I would prioritize creating a safe space for team members to express their concerns and opinions openly. Additionally, I would implement conflict resolution techniques, such as mediation or facilitated discussions, to address underlying issues directly. By fostering open dialogue and empathetic understanding, my goal is to promote a more collaborative and productive team environment.
