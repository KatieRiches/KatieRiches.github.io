          this course. It will be readdressed as required.

        <p>
          My strengths include that I have great time management skills. I like
          to avoid stress where possible so I have developed good organisation
          systems. I am also good at getting people back on track. When in group
          work I like to keep the situation project focussed so we can achieve
          the outcome.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          A limitation I have is that if the work is not challenging or
          stimulating I struggle to maintain focus. I like to be working hard
          and achieving tangible outcomes so when a task appears more wishy
          washy I struggle to be as actively interested.

        <p>
          Often I get so task orientated that people become a secondary skill. I
          am hoping through this course I will be able to develop a better human
          focused orientation.

          There are a few things to remember, firstly that everyone is human and
          deserves to be treated with respect.
          <br />
          Secondly that we are not doing anything so important that you can't
          walk away and take a break.
        </p>

        <p>
          Exercise is a fundamental aspect of my mental health. I train everyday
          and it is a good way to keep the stress out üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. When a problem is
          building up I like to take a break. Get away from the computer be it
          for a walk, some lunch or a breather.

          I practice the 3 before me philosophy, this is to look at three

          As the content so far is pre recorded, my main expectation is for
          pretty quick student support. As the course develops I expect this
          role will develop more into a course delivery role and facilitators
          will be there on the edge to answer student queries.

          Currently I drop my son off at day care, but I am also the closest to
          the day care so should there be an emergency or sickness I will be the
          one to rush in to grab him until my husband can get back to care for
          him.
