    <div class="paragraph">
      <h2>Long term pathway</h2>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to own my own business. I want to be time rich to be able to work remotely and choose when I work. To achieve this I want to work in a dev team to upskill for a few years and understand the industry. I have a specific interest in the agricultural industry and how technology can help this industry with climate issues.
      </p>
    </div>
 
    <div class="paragraph">
      <h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>
      <p>
        My strengths include that I have great time management skills. I like to avoid stress where possible so I have developed good organisation systems. I am also good at getting people back on track. When in group work I like to keep the situation project focussed so we can achieve the outcome. 
</p>
<p>
        A limitation I have is that if the work is not challenging or stimulating I struggle to maintain focus. I like to be working hard and achieving tangible outcomes so when a task appears more wishy washy I struggle to be as actively interested. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <h2>Skills to develop</h2>
      <p>
        Often I get so task orientated that people become a secondary skill. I am hoping through this course I will be able to develop a better human focused orientation.

    <div class="paragraph">
      <h2>Workload management</h2>
      <h4>Communication in the group</h4>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>1. Keep the Chat Flowing:

            Emojis, gifs, and memes are in the communication arsenal. 📱🤳
            Listen up and reply ASAP; this ensures no one feels ignored got time for radio silence.
            </li>
            <li>2. Stay Chill and Organized:

              Use apps and tech to manage life. 📅📲
              Make a to-do list, set priorities, and avoid last-minute stress.
              </li>
              <li>
                3. Spread Love, Not Drama:

Handle issues with respect and openness. 💬❤️
If things get wild, bring in a mediator to keep the peace.


              </li>
              <li>
                4. Celebrate Diversity and Stay Real:

Respect differences and make everyone feel like they belong. 🌍✌️
Dress to impress but keep it real, and stick to the code – low-key style.

              </li>
        </ul>

      <h4>How to deal with stress</h4>
      <p>
        Exercise is a fundamental aspect of my mental health. I train everyday and it is a good way to keep the stress out 🏋️‍♂️. 

When a problem is building up I like to take a break. Get away from the computer be it for a walk, some lunch or a breather.

      </p>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <h2>Time management</h2>
      <p>I practice the 3 before me philosophy, this is to look at three different sources before asking for help directly
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <h2>Facilitation Team</h2>
      <p>As the content so far is pre recorded, my main expectation is for pretty quick student support. As the course develops I expect this role will develop more into a course delivery role and facilitators will be there on the edge to answer student queries.
</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <h2>Scheduling blocks</h2>
    <p>Currently I drop my son off at day care, but I am also the closest to the day care so should there be an emergency or sickness I will be the one to rush in to grab him until my husband can get back to care for him.
