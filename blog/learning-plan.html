        <h2>Goals, strengths, and limitations</h2>
<p>The long term goal of becoming a web developer is to be able to work and travel remotely. I would like to work for myself at some stage as well. </p>

<p>The strengths and limitations I have expressed in Foundations have been accurate. When the work was easy or not particularly interesting I struggled to work through it. I have good time management so even though I had to take a few days easy while sick it did not hinder my progress. </p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>The biggest challenges I think I will face include the pair programming, I think this will be hard to connect with over the internet. This is a skill I think would be more beneficial in person.  </p>
<p>I think looping listening would be a great skill to develop more as well as a better growth mindset. I would like to not be as concerned about asking questions in the discord channel. </p>

      <h2>Bootcamp Team</h2>
<p>I am hoping for a more interactive environment. I found this a bit lacking in the foundations part of the course. I am looking forward to having in person classes and working with a group. </p>
<p>My expectations for myself is to ensure I stay on top of the workload by keeping to time frames. This requires admitting when something is challenging and asking for help. </p>   
<p>I will ensure I am eating well and taking moving breaks. I will use meditation before each morning code session to get my focus on the right things.</p>

        <p>
          My strengths include that I have great time management skills. I like
          to avoid stress where possible so I have developed good organisation
          systems. I am also good at getting people back on track. When in group
          work I like to keep the situation project focussed so we can achieve
          the outcome.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          A limitation I have is that if the work is not challenging or
          stimulating I struggle to maintain focus. I like to be working hard
          and achieving tangible outcomes so when a task appears more wishy
          washy I struggle to be as actively interested.

        <p>
          Often I get so task orientated that people become a secondary skill. I
          am hoping through this course I will be able to develop a better human
          focused orientation.

          There are a few things to remember, firstly that everyone is human and
          deserves to be treated with respect.
          <br />
          Secondly that we are not doing anything so important that you can't
          walk away and take a break.
        </p>

        <p>
          Exercise is a fundamental aspect of my mental health. I train everyday
          and it is a good way to keep the stress out üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. When a problem is
          building up I like to take a break. Get away from the computer be it
          for a walk, some lunch or a breather.

          As the content so far is pre recorded, my main expectation is for
          pretty quick student support. As the course develops I expect this
          role will develop more into a course delivery role and facilitators
          will be there on the edge to answer student queries.

          Currently I drop my son off at day care, but I am also the closest to
          the day care so should there be an emergency or sickness I will be the
          one to rush in to grab him until my husband can get back to care for
          him.
