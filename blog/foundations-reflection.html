          <h2>Values and programming </h2>
<p>Three new things I learnt about myself in this and my ego during foundations are,</p>
<ul>
 <li> 1.	I struggle with admitting I can’t do something and asking for help. It seemed like hardly anyone was asking for help in the discord channels and that put me off. </li>
<li>  2.	I like a challenge, I enjoy struggling and having a moment of panic before pulling myself together and sorting my shit. </li>
<li>  3.	I need to read instructions better. I could save myself a lot of stress by reading the whole set of instructions before starting the project.</li>
</ul>
  <p>
  Values, empathy and self-awareness are necessary in any job not just programming. They give us an opportunity to understand the person behind the job and realise at the end of the day no one is going to die if we don’t get a job finished.

        <h2>Challenging Surprises</h2>
<p>The biggest surprise of the foundations course was how much I was already comfortable with.  This was reassuring and I am looking forward to the next challenges
</p>
<p>
  The most challenging aspect of the foundations programme was the carnival tasks. The unicorn and clown stuffed me up for a long time and it was really great to finish those tasks.

        <h2>The value of core</h2>
<p>
  It is important to spend time developing core skills. These are beneficial for everyday living and previously have not been considered a necessity to learn. Due to this a lot of people of a certain age have not developed these skills.  To be successful in a work environment one has to be good at communicating an listening to listen not listening to respond. 
  </p>
  <p> 
  Sometimes the time did feel a bit too strongly one the core – specifically as a self lead process. If this is a skill you have never placed value in it is hard to initially see the benefit. I think this could be mitigated by more tutor lead learning in this field particularly as a team. Maybe as part of the check in times.
