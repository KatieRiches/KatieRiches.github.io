          <h3>Brain blocked</h3>
          <p>I was stuck on a problem, I thought I had the code right, all the resources I was reading were writing it the same way and I could not find the issue. I ended up reading it aloud and found an extra comma where it shouldn't be.</p>

        <h3>Elegant problem solving</h3>
<p> I was stuck on a challenge the other day. I had the code ridht but instead of showing every other word it was showing the opposite. I  started to record a video complaining, when by talking through the problem I managed to solve it.</p>

        <h2>Different techniques and reflections</h2>
        <p>Pseudo code has beeen a huge advantage I didn't expect. Talking through the problem or the rubber ducky mthod is also a favourite technique.</p>
      <p>I am often reluctant to ask for help. In partucular when we are all working individually as I don't want to look like I am behind or struggling, this come from a fixed mindset that I am trying to change into a growth mindset.</p>
