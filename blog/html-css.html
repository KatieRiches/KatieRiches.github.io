            This is where we would add the intro for relative, absolute and
            fixed positioning.

    <section class="static">

          <p>
            Static is the defaul position for elements on the page. Static does
            not mean much other than the element will flow onto the page as it
            normally should. static; is to forcefully remove some positioning
            that got applied to an element outside of your control. This is
            fairly rare, as positioning doesnâ€™t cascade. In code it can be
            applied as this: { position: static; }
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

    <section class="relative">
      <div class="container">
        <div>
          <p>
            Relative positioning can be somewhat confusing. Relative positioning
            by itself will have no effect and will appear the same way as a
            statically placed image. To have any effect it has to be relative to
            some other positioning attribute, say, top: 10px;, it will shift its
            position 10 pixels down from where it would normally be. Other
            content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the
            element.

            <br />
            <br />
            In this example, you will see how the relative positioned element
            moves when its attributes are changed. The first element moves to
            the left and top from its normal position, while the second element
            stays in the same place because none of the additional positioning
            attributes were changed.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="fixed">
      <div class="container">
        <div>
          <p>
            A fixed position element is fixed relative to the viewport or the
            browser window. Th viewport doesn't change when the window is
            scrolled, so a fixed position element will stay right where it is
            when the page moves.

            <br />
            This is useful for something like a nav bar where you want the bar
            to be visible at all stages. The concern with fixed positioning is
            that it can cause situations where the fixed element overlaps
            content such that is is inaccessible. The trick is having enough
            space to avoid that
